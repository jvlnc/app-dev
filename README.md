## my favorite series
My favorite series at the moment is **Designated Survivor**, an American political thriller series with three seasons. It's about Tom Kirkman, an academic and the Secretary of House and Urban Development, being named the *designated survivor*, a member in the presidential line of succession chosen to be at a different location when the others in the line are gathered together to reduce the chance of everyone in the line being taken out in the chance of a mass-casualty event. When a devastating attack during a State of the Union happens, he becomes the President of the United States. A favorite quote I have from that series would be from the scene when Alex Kirkman, the First Lady and my most beloved character in the show, says,
> So, what do you want me to do? Sit down and shut up, is that it? [No, I didn't say that.] Yes, you did, and that's okay 'cause that's your job, but here is mine: as a wife of 17 years and an immigration attorney of 22, I am gonna counsel my husband through this. And if there is a political fallout, I trust that you can handle it.
